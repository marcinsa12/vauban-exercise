## Guidelines

You will build an application that allow an user to search through a list of Star Wars characters and add them to his personal list.

- Display a list of characters into nice cards with their informations
- Implement a search function that filter the list of characters
- Display the list of selected characters by the user

You will find the list of characters into **data/characters.js** file. 


You can add any other external packages if you need.

We will pay intention to the way you organize your project and how you handle interactions inside your application.
